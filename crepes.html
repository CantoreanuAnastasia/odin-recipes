    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p><strong>Crepe recipes vary, but most include flour, liquid (milk and/or water), and salt. Restaurants usually make them with a specialty pan, but a regular skillet works in any home kitchen.

        Why are they a favorite? Crepes are popular because their versatility makes them FUN to eat. Rolled up or folded, you can stuff and top them with virtually anything. 
        Nutella, whipped cream, and berries is a common choice, but savory fillings work just as well. 
        Fold or roll them up and enjoy trying a variety of fillings and flavors. You’re definitely not limited!</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unsalted Butter:</strong>Unsalted Butter: Butter is a key ingredient. Have extra butter handy for the skillet.</li>
            <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour:</strong> Flour is another key ingredient, providing the overall structure. I haven’t tried any successful gluten free alternatives, but let me know if you do!</li>
            <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> These are lightly sweetened– you only need 1 Tablespoon.
                Salt: A pinch of salt adds flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Milk & Water:</strong>Crepe batter needs liquid. Using all water created a limp and lacking crepe, while using all milk created a heavy crepe. For the best texture, use a mix of both.
                 Trust me.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>As they do in pancake batter, eggs provide structure and bind all the ingredients together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla Extract:</strong>Adds flavor– you’ll definitely smell the vanilla as you cook these on the stove! 
                Feel free to leave it out if you make savory style crepes.</li>
        </ul>
<p>Steps</p>

 <li>Melt the butter: Melt some butter in the microwave or on the stove. Let it cool for a few minutes before using in the batter. 
    (Otherwise you could scramble the eggs.)Melt the butter: Melt some butter in the microwave or on the stove.

<li> Combine all ingredients in a blender: Add the cooled melted butter and all the remaining ingredients into a blender. 
    A blender works WONDERFULLY to smooth out the batter because it cuts that flour perfectly into all the wet ingredients.
    If you don’t have a blender, just use a mixing bowl and whisk. </li> 
<li>Chill the batter: Chill the crepe batter for at least 30-60 minutes before cooking it. 
    This time in the refrigerator is crucial to the taste, texture, and success of your crepes. Use this time to clean up and get your skillet ready. 
    You can even chill the batter overnight so it’s ready to cook the next day.</li>
<li>Butter & heat a small skillet: Generously butter the pan and keep butter nearby for greasing the pan between each crepe too.
    Though professional chefs may use a specialty crepe pan, I find a small 8-inch skillet (affiliate link*) works perfectly at home. 
    If you don’t have a small skillet, use a larger one but make sure you keep the crepes THIN. </li>
<li>Look crepes one at a time: The longest part of this recipe is standing over the stove and cooking them one at a time over medium heat. 
    Use only 3-4 Tablespoons of batter per crepe. (I usually use 3 Tablespoons.) 
    The less you use and the larger you stretch the crepe, the thinner they’ll be. 
    As you can see in my video tutorial above, I twirl the pan so the batter stretches as far as it can go. If you don’t do this, your crepes will be pretty thick and taste like tortillas.
    Still delicious, but very different.
    Flip the crepe over and cook the other side, too.</li>
<li>Serve with favorite fillings: I love serving them warm with cold whipped cream and fresh berries.
