    <h1>Pizza Margherita</h1>

    <img src="../odin-recipes/images/pizza.jpg">
    <p> This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta’s restaurant in Brooklyn, 
        who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p></p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>

    <h2>Recipe instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.</li>
        <li>Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately 1/2 inch from the edges.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over the top.</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
